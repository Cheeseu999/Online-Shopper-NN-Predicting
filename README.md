The MLP was written and trained in the Jupyter notebook. The accompanying paper "Online Shopping Prediction Paper.pdf" explains the model building and implementation of the MLP onto the dataset.

The data was sourced from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset). The dataset comprises 12,330 sessions of online users visiting a website, with each session attributed to a distinct user. Each session tracked 18 variables (10 numerical and 8 categorical), which are detailed in the paper. 

The goal of this project is to see if user behavior can predict whether they will make an online purchase or not. In further applications, this could help online shopping websites track users in real-time who are likely to make a purchase and prioritize them accordingly.
